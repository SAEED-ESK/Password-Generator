Generator of Passwords: Strong passwords can be generated for us by a GUI application. This application won’t require any sort of web connection because it’s a Graphical User Interface (GUI) programme.

This GUI application will ask the user to enter the length of the password he/she wants and the pass. A button will be provided and on clicking that button, a password that contains upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols will be generated.
